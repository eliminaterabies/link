What data do we need for each project? What decisions should we make? Do any of them need to be different?

MLi: Figure out what are the overlaps for R0 and correlations
	- linked (link biters with bitees)
		- Multiple exposures are a problem, do we handle them here? 
		- The major problem is when both the biter and/or bitee have multiple exposures thus, it will create multiple links. 
		- For example, if my biter have multiple exposures, then I have mutliple links. If I have multiple exposures, then I will have multiple links for each of my exposures.
	- calc (calculate time intervals from dates)
	- once (Dropping animals bitten more than once)
	- incubations (biter, bitee, weighted incubations)
	- intervals (tidy time intervals and compute statistics)

## R0 paper

bitten. and linked. are just lists of scalars; intervals is a list of computed intervals

## Correlations paper

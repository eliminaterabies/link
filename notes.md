What data do we need for each project? What decisions should we make? Do any of them need to be different?

MLi: Figure out what are the overlaps for R0 and correlations
	- linked (link biters with bitees)
	- calc (calculate time intervals from dates)
	- once (Dropping animals bitten more than once)
	- incubations (biter, bitee, weighted incubations)
	- intervals (tidy time intervals and compute statistics)

## R0 paper

bitten. and linked. are just lists of scalars; intervals is a list of computed intervals

## Correlations paper

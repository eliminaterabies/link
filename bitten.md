We wamt all bites in the bitten data frame. Maybe it should be called bites. But we only want one record per dog in the biter data frame, for linking.

A dog with two bites with rabies flags (Suspected, bestInc, or Symptoms) should not have any incubation period. Any dog with two different Symptoms.started should not have any Symptom.started date.

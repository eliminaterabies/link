## Goes with bitten.R

We want all bites in the bitten data frame. 

## Dogs bitten multiple times

We first screen out bites that are reported to be linked to “no” or “impossible” rabies, _unless_ they have an incubation period or a Symptom date.

We then keep track of how many bites a dog has for the future.

We don't remove anything yet, because we hope to do more better screening downstream.

=================

Working on this pretty actively now. Not yet fixed downstream.

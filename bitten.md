Was looking for dogs with multiple “bitten” records but different Suspect or symptom info. The theory was that these would be inconsistencies. Some are, but they're mostly not. They're mostly dogs that were bitten and didn't get sick, and were bitten again later. Some were listed as "Suspect" but survived to get bitten again.
